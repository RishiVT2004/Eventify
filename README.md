npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and define the following variables:
```env
PORT=<your-port-number>
URL=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_KEY=<your-jwt-secret-key>
EMAIL_ID=<your-email-id>
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-email-password> # App password, not Gmail password
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<your-razorpay-key-id>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<your-razorpay-key-secret>
```

### 4. Database Setup

- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally, or opt for a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
- Set the database URL in the `.env` file (`URL` key).
- Collections such as `Users`, `Events`, `Bookings`, and `Payments` will be automatically created when the server starts.

### 5. Run the Server

To start the development server, use:
```bash
node server.js
```
For automatic restarts during development, use:
```bash
nodemon server.js
```
